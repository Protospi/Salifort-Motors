**Readme File - Employee Turnover Prediction Project**

This readme file provides an overview of the Employee Turnover Prediction project, detailing each stage of the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute) strategy, as well as highlighting key findings and recommendations.

### Project Overview:

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to predict employee turnover within the organization and provide insights to help improve employee retention.

**Audience:** The project's primary audience is the senior leadership team at Salifort Motors, who are concerned about high employee turnover rates and are seeking solutions to address this issue.

### PACE Strategy - Plan Stage:

In the **Plan** stage, we define the project's scope, objectives, and initial questions to be answered:

**Key Questions:**
- What factors contribute to employee turnover?
- How can we predict which employees are likely to leave?
- What strategies can be implemented to improve employee retention?

**Resources Required:** To undertake this project, we need access to the HR_capstone_dataset.csv, which contains self-reported information from employees of Salifort Motors.

**Milestones for Planning:**
1. Define project objectives and scope.
2. Identify key questions to address.
3. Obtain and preprocess the HR dataset.

### PACE Strategy - Analyze Stage:

In the **Analyze** stage, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and formulate hypotheses:

**Key EDA Findings:**
- Employees are working long hours, with some exceeding 75 hours per week.
- Dissatisfaction levels are linked to longer working hours.
- A correlation exists between hours worked and evaluation scores.
- Employees with four years of tenure exhibit lower satisfaction levels.

**Ethical Considerations:** During this stage, ethical considerations include ensuring data privacy and maintaining the anonymity of employees.

**Milestones for Analysis:**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Identify potential correlations and patterns.
3. Address any missing or incomplete data.

### PACE Strategy - Construct Stage:

In the **Construct** stage, we build and evaluate predictive models to address the project's objectives:

**Key Modeling Results:**
- We constructed a Logistic Regression model:
   - Precision: 80%
   - Recall: 83%
   - F1-Score: 80%
   - Accuracy: 83%

- We utilized Tree-Based Machine Learning (Decision Tree):
   - AUC: 93.8%
   - Precision: 87.0%
   - Recall: 90.4%
   - F1-Score: 88.7%
   - Accuracy: 96.2%

**Notable Findings:**
- Employee overwork is a significant contributor to turnover.
- Recommendations include capping project numbers, addressing four-year employee dissatisfaction, and clarifying overtime policies.

**Ethical Considerations:** Ethical considerations include model fairness, bias mitigation, and data privacy.

**Milestones for Construction:**
1. Build and evaluate predictive models.
2. Extract key feature importances and insights.
3. Address ethical considerations.

### PACE Strategy - Execute Stage:

In the **Execute** stage, we summarize findings, provide recommendations, and outline next steps:

**Summary of Findings:**
- Employee overwork is a critical issue contributing to turnover.
- Recommendations include workload capping, addressing four-year employee dissatisfaction, and fostering a healthier work culture.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate potential data leakage regarding "last_evaluation."
- Explore alternative predictors, such as performance scores or satisfaction scores.
- Consider a K-Means analysis for further insights.

**Milestones for Execution:**
1. Summarize findings and provide recommendations.
2. Outline next steps for further analysis and improvements.

### Conclusion:

The Employee Turnover Prediction project utilizes the PACE strategy to tackle the issue of employee turnover within Salifort Motors. Through rigorous analysis, modeling, and ethical considerations, the project has highlighted the importance of addressing employee overwork as a key contributor to turnover.

By providing data-driven recommendations and outlining next steps, the project aims to support the organization in improving employee retention, ultimately fostering a healthier and more productive work environment.
